# Introduction

The clinical question of phase I study is mainly to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of investigational treatments, in order to establish the safe and appropriate dose level that could be used in the following phase II trial. The critical part of finding MTD in phase I is that the number of participants in phase I study are usually just in dozens, and investigators need to efficiently locate the true MTD with limited sample and within short trial window, this process calls for accurate and transparent trial design which can accommodate flexible and versatile clinical settings in real-world. 
The most traditional and widely used methods to find MTD is 3+3 design, under which, cohorts of three participants are assigned a set of dose level, if 1/3 is experiencing DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicities), then another cohort of three participants is give the same level of dose; If more than 2/3 or 2/6 DLTs are observed, then terminate the trial and declare the dose below current is MTD; Otherwise, continue the trial and escalate the dose level for next cohort. As the adaptive design getting utilized in clinical trials, more and more novel phase I methods have been introduced, such as continual reassessment method (CRM), Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (BOIN), Modified Toxicity Probability Interval Design (mTPI), Escalation with overdose control (EWOC), Bayes Logistic Regression Model (BLRM), etc. 
The focus of this project is BOIN, a method introduced by
