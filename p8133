# Introduction

The clinical question of phase I study is mainly to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of investigational treatment, in order to decide the safe and appropriate dose level range that will be studied in the following phase II trial. The critical part of finding MTD in phase I is that the number of participants in phase I study are usually just in dozens, and investigators need to efficiently locate the true MTD with limited sample and within short trial window, this process calls for accurate and easy-implement trial design which can accommodate flexible and versatile clinical settings in real-world. The most traditional and widely used methods to find MTD is 3+3 design. As the adaptive design getting utilized in clinical trials, more and more novel phase I methods have been introduced, such as continual reassessment method (CRM), Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (BOIN), Modified Toxicity Probability Interval Design (mTPI), Escalation with overdose control (EWOC), Bayes Logistic Regression Model (BLRM), etc.
